# Dimensionality-reduction


Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a significant global health concern, affecting millions worldwide and leading to high mortality rates. Early and accurate detection of CKD stages can greatly enhance patient management and treatment outcomes. Leveraging machine learning, this project explores the potential of dimensionality reduction techniques to improve diagnostic models by handling large datasets and identifying complex patterns that may elude human analysis.

This project employs three prominent dimensionality reduction techniques—Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Factor Analysis—to analyze the Chronic Kidney Disease dataset hosted on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. These methods are evaluated for their effectiveness in reducing dataset dimensionality, uncovering hidden patterns, and improving machine learning model performance.
